# Numeronym the Web

Numeronyms are more common than you think. Things like a11y, i18n, k8s - all [numeronyms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeronym).

TL;DR - numeronyms are where the middle characters of a string are replaced with the number of characters replaced.

The first numeronym was believed to be a shortening of Jan Scherpenhuizen's last name for his email address to s12n. This is why throughout this extension's code, you will find variable and function names referencing s12n.

This extension can convert an entire webpage's text content to numeronyms and back again. Do what you will with that.
